"First, LangChain packages with create_react_agent are deprecated in the source code of the original task definition. " \
"Secondly, made System Prompt to instruct LLM to use Tools if they are available. " \

None of the known venues meet the capacity and dietary requirements for 300 people with vegan options.

This would not be fully acceptable in a real booking assistant. The response is generic and does not clearly explain that train times are outside the assistants scope. 
A better response would explicitly say that the assistant only handles booking-related venue tasks and cannot help with rail travel information.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
The most unexpected behaviour was that the agent kept calling the flyer generation
tool with the same arguments instead of stopping after the tool returned a result.
During Task B it tried the flyer call multiple times, which made the run feel like
it was stuck in a tool loop. I fixed the run by tightening the system prompt so it
would not repeat successful tool calls, and by adding tool-call extraction logic so
the trace showed what the agent was actually doing.
